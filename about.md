Hello! My name is Rahul Gupta. I have a middle name too. It's Kartikeya. That was actually supposed to be my first name. Anyways, this about page is supposed to tell you about me. Well. I was born and raised in San Jose, California. I went to a Jesuit Catholic (All male) high school called Bellarmine College Preparatory (go bells), and I went to UC Berkeley (go bears) for college. I currently live in San Francisco (specifically the Haight, previously the Mission) and I work at company called Affirm (previously Okta) as a software developer (yes I'm a techie).

I love the Bay Area, and I care deeply about making the Bay Area a better place to live. I am a member of [Yimby Action](https://www.yimbyaction.org/), [SPUR](http://www.spur.org), and [SF Bike Coalition](http://www.sfbike.org/) to name a couple of local organizations.
