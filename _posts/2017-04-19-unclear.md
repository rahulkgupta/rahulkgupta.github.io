Like the majority of personal sites, this one has languished. I rarely update it. I don't really know what to do with it. Every time I come back to it, I want to start over. Yet, every time time I think about writing a piece or working on a project, I worry about its quality and whether it's "worth putting on this site."

I want this site to grow. In order to do that, I have to be ok with publishing things that are not perfect. So with that in mind, I apologize in advance for any grammatical errors, mistakes in my work, and the entire site as a whole.

This site will hopefully be in flux in the upcoming months. I want to redesign it. At the time of writing, it looks like it was designed by a hermit. This link is probably going to break, so apologies to all those who are bookmarking this link.

Hopefully, I'll be back in less than a month.
