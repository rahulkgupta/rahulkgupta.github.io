One of my favorite quotations from Barack Obama was the very misquoted line, "You didn't build that" because it made me think about all the ways I received help throughout my life.

My parents provided the biggest contribution to my life. They stressed education, knowledge, hard work, and humility. My dad worked really hard to provide us with a great education, and my mom was selfless enough to give up her career to take care of my brother and me. My dad was even able to put me through college because he had saved enough money and invested wisely, protecting me from student debt.  My parents sacrificed their own happiness to promote mine. My parents also helped me by bootstrapping a positive social network for me.

The people I grew up with were mostly the kids of my parents' friends, who held similar values as my parents. This fostered a community of children who were, for lack of better word, nerds. We were all nerds, and we were close with one another. For that reason, we didn't have any negative influences in our lives to sway us from our nerdly paths. We fostered each other's thirst for knowledge, and we pushed each other to do better. We all had solid moral compasses as well, thanks to our parents.

All of these benefits I received are pure luck. I had nothing to do with them. I'm not saying I grew up in the absolutely perfect setup, but I had it pretty damn good. I'm sure if you're reading this, that you probably had it pretty good as well, and if you didn't, still reflect on the ways in which you were lucky. I could have been born anywhere else, or unhealthy, or to abusive parents, or to a whole host of unfortunate circumstances. However, for some unknown reason, or for no reason at all, I was born lucky.
