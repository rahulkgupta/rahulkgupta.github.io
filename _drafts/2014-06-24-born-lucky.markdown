One of my favorite quotes from Barack Obama was the very misquoted line, "You didn't build that" because it made me think about all the ways in which I was helped out throughout my life. My parents were probably provided the biggest contribution to my life. They stressed education, knowledge, hard work, and humility. They even put us through private school, by saving money and spending little on everything else. My dad had the fortune to be able to afford enough and my mom was selfless enough to give up her career to take care of my brother and me.
